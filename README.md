- **User preferences** - users can opt in/out of email notifications
- **Comprehensive results** including win rate, payout details, and actual game results
- **Direct link** to view full results in the app

### Setup:

1. Get a free Resend API key at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   EMAIL_FROM=notifications@resend.dev
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```
3. Run the database migration to add email preferences:
   ```sql
   -- This adds email preference columns to profiles table
   ALTER TABLE profiles
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_notifications_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_simulation_completion BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
   ```

### User Controls:

- Users can manage email preferences in their profile page
- Global email notification toggle
- Specific toggle for simulation completion emails
- Users are opted-in by default but can disable anytime

- Node.js 18+
- Supabase account
- Resend account (for email notifications)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your Supabase credentials
   - Add your Resend API key
   - Set other required variables

5. Run database migrations:

   - Apply the migrations in the `supabase/migrations/` directory

6. Start the development servers:

   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && python run.py

   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

## Database Schema

The application uses Supabase with the following key tables:

- `profiles` - User profiles and preferences (including email settings)
- `jackpots` - Sports betting jackpots
- `games` - Individual games within jackpots
- `simulations` - User simulation configurations
- `bet_combinations` - Generated betting combinations
- `simulation_results` - Analysis results
- `notifications` - In-app notifications

## Email Template Design

The email notifications feature beautiful, mobile-responsive HTML emails that include:

- Gradient header with app branding
- Success/failure status indicators
- Detailed results table with win rates and payouts
- Visual representation of actual game results
- Call-to-action button to view full results
- Footer with preference management link
